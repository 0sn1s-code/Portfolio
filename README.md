## Requirements

Before using this GitHub Action, make sure you have the following set up:

- Vercel account: Sign up for a Vercel account at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
- Vercel token: Generate a Vercel token with appropriate permissions in your Vercel account settings. Add the token as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository.
- Vercel organization ID: Obtain your Vercel organization ID and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_ORG_ID` in your GitHub repository.
- Vercel project ID: Obtain the project ID for your Vercel project and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STATIC` in your GitHub repository.

## Workflow Details

The GitHub Action workflow is triggered on every push to the `preview/fix` branch. Here's an overview of the workflow steps:

1. **Checkout code:** This step checks out the repository code for the workflow to run on.

2. **Allow unsecure commands:** This step sets an environment variable to allow unsecure commands during the workflow.

3. **Deploy to Staging:** This step uses the Vercel GitHub Action (`amondnet/vercel-action`) to deploy the React application to Vercel. It requires the Vercel token, organization ID, project ID, and scope as secret inputs.

## Usage

To use this GitHub Action in your repository, create a YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/vercel.yaml`) and copy the provided workflow code into it. Make sure to set up the required secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

```yaml

      - name: Deploy to Staging
        id: deploy-vercel-staging
