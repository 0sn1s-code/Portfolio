## TL;DR

Fork this repo to modify and make changes of your own. Give proper credit by linking back to [your-username](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name). Thanks!

## Requirements

Before using this GitHub Action, ensure you have the following set up:

- Vercel account: Sign up at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
- Vercel token: Generate a token in your Vercel account settings. Add it as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository.
- Vercel organization ID: Obtain your organization ID and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_ORG_ID`.
- Vercel project ID: Obtain the project ID and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STATIC`.

## Workflow Details

The workflow is triggered on every push to the `preview/fix` branch. Overview of the steps:

1. **Checkout code:** This step checks out the repository code.

2. **Allow unsecure commands:** This step enables unsecure commands during the workflow.

3. **Deploy to Staging:** Uses the Vercel GitHub Action (`amondnet/vercel-action`) to deploy the React application to Vercel. Requires the Vercel token, organization ID, project ID, and scope as secret inputs.

## Usage

Create a YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/vercel.yaml`) and copy the provided workflow code into it. Set up required secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

```yaml
name: Vercel Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - preview/fix

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Allow unsecure commands
        run: echo "ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to Staging
        id: deploy-vercel-staging
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STATIC}}
